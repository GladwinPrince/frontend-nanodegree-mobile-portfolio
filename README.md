## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

### GitHub pages URL(to test in PageSpeed Insights): https://gladwinprince.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/

##### Optimizations Done:
1. Compressed and Resized versions of every image is used to reduce load time.
2. Render blocking CSS are replaced with CSS media queries, where possible.
3. Parser blocking JS scripts were loaded asynchronously, where possible.
4. Custom Font was removed due to its impact on performance.
5. Minified version of all JS scripts are used to reduce Load time.

##### Note:
1. Google PageSpeed Insights recommends Browser Caching of CSS and JS scripts for a minimum of 8 days, but as I am using Github pages (which doesn't support .htaccess file or .config files due to security reasons) that only allows 10mins of caching. This recommendation cannot be fullfilled.

2. Google PageSpeed Insights recommends Eliminating render blocking CSS/JS scripts, and suggests inline CSS as an alternative, but inlining large CSS blocks doesn't serve the basic purpose of CSS, splitting HTML and style elements. Hence, I have linked the CSS at the end of body, which makes it last to load and doesn't block any rendering.

3. Google PageSpeed Insights recommends that the server responds in 200ms, but Github pages sometimes takes about 300ms to respond.

###### Even though these recommendations can't be implemented, still the Page usually scores a 90+/100 in both Mobile and Desktop.

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

##### Optimization Done:
1. The Layout reads in updatePositions() method was implemented initially, and the style changes are grouped together. This was done to attain 60FPS frame rate.

2. The determineDx() method has been replaced with a much simpler working. This seems to resize Pizza sizes within 1ms most of the time.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
